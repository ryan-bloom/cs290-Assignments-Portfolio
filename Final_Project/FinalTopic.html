        For our final project, we will work to create a website that will enable people to more easily plan out their visits and tours of various colleges.  This is an interesting topic because many people, while looking trying to figure out which colleges to apply to, take college trips on which they visit 3 or 4 different schools.  At each school, people usually try to attend an information session about the school, as well as a tour of the campus.  However, while planning these trips, it is often very difficult to coordinate which schools have available information sessions and tours that do not overlap and that allow you to visit each school during one trip.  For example, if someone is planning on visiting University of Pennsylvania, Duke, and Vanderbilt, it could be difficult to determine which school to visit first based on which schools offer information sessions and tours at what compatible times.  Therefore, our project will attempt to provide an easy solution to this problem.

        In order to do accomplish this, our website will allow users to input the various schools that they wish to visit, as well as the dates that they plan on going.  Then, our website will use data from each school’s website regarding the information sessions and tours that are offered at that school during these dates.  Using this information, as well as information regarding how long it would take to travel between schools, our website will give back various schedules that allow the user to visit each school that he/she entered, taking a tour and sitting in on an information session at each one.  Then, if a schedule incorporating these schools is possible, the user will be able to select which of the schedules he/she wishes to follow, and save that information.  We will use data from university websites and user inputs in order to make people visiting schools’ lives much easier.
