Bloom,

I really like your web app and I think it is a super interesting idea that would definitely be useful for many people. I think the schedule could be a little more straightforward, but it is great that it comes up so quickly. I also like the ability of users to add mark themselves on different trips. It is also very handy that you can save schedules. Thanks for letting me test out your site, and I hope you’re having a great time in college. 

Best,

Riley
