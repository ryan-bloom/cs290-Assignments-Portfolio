Hi Ryan!

When first entering the website the aesthetics were a little underwhelming; however, the functionality of the app makes up for it. The idea behind the app is very useful and is well executed. The randomized schedules ensure that there is a variety of options for the user to choose from. The public/ private option when making schedules at first was confusing to me. However, it provides a good database for guest users to look through. The map option creates a good visual of distance in order to assist the user  to make an informed decision of their college tour scheduling. The main improvement I would make is visual appearance.
