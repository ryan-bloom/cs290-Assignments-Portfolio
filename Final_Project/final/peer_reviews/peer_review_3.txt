Hey!

I think the home page can be a little bit cleaner looking, but it’s easy to use and understandable. I really like the idea for the website, I think it solves an important problem for a lot of high school students. I like that there’s the feature where you can see public schedules so you would be able to link up with friends. Great job!!
