<h1>My Hobbies:</h1>
<hr />
<h2><i>Skiing:</i></h2>
	<p>Skiing is one of, if not my favorite thing to do.  I started skiing when I was 7 years old and have loved it ever since. I go on trips with friends and my family, and my favorite places to ski are Utah and Colorado.  This past semester, I was lucky enough to be studying abroad in Australia and I got to ski in Australia as well.  I hope to someday be able to ski in Alaska, Chile, and Switzerland.  Below is the trailer to one of my favorite skiing movies, Art of Flight.</p>

<h2><i>Art (Drawing):</i></h2>
	<p>Another hobby of mine is drawing.  I took art classes all throughout high school, and have taken a couple drawing courses here at Duke as well, and I'm thinking about potentially trying to add an art minor.  Below are some of my favorite works that I've drawn.</p>

<h2><i>Dallas Cowboys:</i></h2>
	<p>Although I hate to admit it, and despite the fact that I'm from New York, I am a Dallas Cowboys fan.  I have been a Cowboys fan for my entire life because my Dad made me this way.  I know that they aren't a good team but next year is our year.</p>
