# portfolio

This repository will be used for ALL your CompSci 290 assignments, thus it will serve as a portfolio of all of your work in this course.

ALL of your assignments (not lab) must be clearly linked to from this site so the course staff can track your progress throughout the course.

You will be graded on what is in the master branch of THIS repository at end of the day the project is due. You are responsible for ensuring that all files are correctly pushed to this repository by then.

Each assignment should be done in a separate folder, with its own README file, so it is clear what has been updated for each assignment.
