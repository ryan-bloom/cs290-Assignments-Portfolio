# csszen README - Ryan Bloom

For the first zen web-page, I attempted to create a colder feeling, using background images that are dominated with blues and whites.  Additionally, I moved the sidebar to the bottom of the page as opposed to off to the side.  Furthermore, I tried to differentiate each section by adding a background color behind the writing.  Finally, I changed the fonts, colors, and sizes of the text so that each section fit nicely inside its background box, and I moved each div box around to format the page in a unique way. 

For the second zen web-page, I attempted to create a warmer feeling, using the sunset as the background image, which is dominated with reds, oranges, and yellows.  Additionally, I restricted the image to appear only behind the introduction, while the remainder of the page has a white background.  Then, instead of placing the sidebar with all of the links below the text, I moved them to the left and shifted some of the text over using the block display method.  Finally, I edited fonts, colors, and sizes, and moved the footer to the bottom right of the website.  

Overall, I spent about two hours on this project and learned a lot about css while doing so.
