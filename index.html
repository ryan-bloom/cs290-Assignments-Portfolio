	<h3><i>Computer Science Autobiography:</i></h3>
	<p>
		I first started using computers as a child (around 7 years old).  Back then, I used a dell desktop and really just used the computer to play games.  Now, I use computers mainly to do work, both for school and for jobs.  On a daily basis, I believe that a computer scientists writes code to create new or improve existing software or websites.  <br><br>
		I took CompSci-101 my freshman year at Duke, which is what initially turned me onto computer science.  Then, for my job last summer, I had to teach myself how to create a website.  After teaching myself the basics, I felt like a course in web development could help me for future jobs.  In order to code different parts of a website, one must pay attention to detail as well as be creative enough to make the website aesthetically pleasing.  I think that computers will continue to progress and be used more and more in people's daily lives.  Specifically, I think that I'll use computers to develope new and exciting software and websites in the future.
